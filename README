# Structure and Intepretation of Computer Programs (SICP)

Exercise solutions.

This book is amazing. Starting with some simple mathematical equations, 
this book teaches programmers how to structure and manage a large code base.
Another side effect after reading this book is that 
I know how to code Scheme and found out Lisp is a beautiful and elegant language.

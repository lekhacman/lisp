# Structure and Intepretation of Computer Programs (SICP)

Exercise solutions.

This book is amazing. Starting with some simple mathematical equations, 
this book teaches programmers how to structure and manage a large code base.
Another side effect after reading this book is that 
I know how to code Scheme and found out Lisp is a beautiful and elegant language.

There are many versions of the book available online.
Here is a good one [https://sarabander.github.io/sicp/](https://sarabander.github.io/sicp/)

If you like SICP as I do, I suggest you to buy the book to support the authors.
I love to read theories and ideas on my hard-copy but while doing exercise, 
it is more convenient to use the soft-copy of the book.
